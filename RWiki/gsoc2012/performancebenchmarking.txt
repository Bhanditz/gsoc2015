**Summary**: R code for Portfolio Performance Measurement and Benchmarking from Christoperson, Carino, and Ferson(2009)

**Description**: 
PerformanceAnalytics is an R package that provides a collection of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis. It applies current research on return-based analysis of strategy or fund returns for risk, autocorrelation and illiquidity, persistence, style analysis and drift, clustering, quantile regression, and other topics. 

As a key repository of important performance and risk benchmarking and attribution functions, it is important to keep up with the latest publications in the field.  Christopherson(2009) is such a publication.  David Cariño is a Research Fellow at Russell Investments, one of the co-authors of this text and would co-mentor this project.

The majority of the measures described in Portfolio Performance Measurement and Benchmarking already exist in Performanceanalytics, but several newer or lesser used functions do not.  A non exhaustive list includes: 
* holding period returns
* linked returns
* cash flow and unit value returns
* money weighted returns
* Modigliani measure
* Appraisal Ratio
* Fixed Income Risk Measures for duration, convexity, prepayment, and issuer-specific risks
* market timing metrics
* portfolio attribution
* linking attribution
* benchmark and index construction

Additionally, there are multiple chapters on factor analysis that may be mostly covered by functions already in the package FactorAnalytics: overlap and required functionality will need to be cross-referenced, with necessary additional functionality created as part of this project.

**Test**:
The successful applicant will demonstrate proficiency with R, and specifically with xts and PerformanceAnalytics or PortfolioAnalytics. This could be via identifying a patch or extension, providing a new demo script for the one of the packages that would show understanding of the functionality provided, or by doing a detailed proposal with pseudocode for one or more potential enhancements to the toolchain. The ideal candidate would also demonstrate prior interest or experience in finance.
