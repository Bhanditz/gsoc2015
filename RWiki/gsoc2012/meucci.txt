===== Summary ===== 
Extend the functionality of key ReturnAnalytics packages with the current research of Attilio Meucci, a thought leader in risk and portfolio management.

===== Description ===== 
Attilio Meucci is a pioneer in advanced risk and portfolio management. His innovations include Entropy Pooling (technique for fully flexible portfolio construction), Factors on Demand (on-the-fly factor model for optimal hedging), Effective Number of Bets (entropy-eigenvalue statistic for diversification management), Fully Flexible Probabilities (technique for on-the-fly stress-test and estimation without re-pricing), and Copula-Marginal Algorithm (algorithm to generate panic copulas).  Attilio Meucci serves as the chief risk officer at Kepos Capital LP. Concurrently, he is adjunct professor at the Master's in Financial Engineering â€“ Baruch College - CUNY.

Attilio has included Matlab code, some of which requires the additional Optimization Toolkit, alongside his key papers to better demonstrate the concepts.  We would like to convert that code to R to make it more widely assessible.

Beyond the initial conversion, we will functionalize key aspects of that code and consider including functions in PerformanceAnalytics, PortfolioAnalytics, or developing a package around one or more of the concepts described above, starting with the Effective Number of Bets.  

PerformanceAnalytics is an R package that provides a collection of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis. PortfolioAnalytics is an extensible business-focused framework for portfolio optimization and analysis.

===== Test ===== 
The successful applicant will demonstrate proficiency with both Matlab and R.  Within R, the candidate should show proficiency with xts and  PerformanceAnalytics or PortfolioAnalytics. This could be via identifying a patch or extension, providing a new demo script for the one of the packages that would show understanding of the functionality provided, or by doing a detailed proposal with pseudocode for one or more potential enhancements to the toolchain. The ideal candidate would also demonstrate prior interest or experience in finance.
