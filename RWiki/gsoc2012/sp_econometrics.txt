====== Bayesian Spatial Econometrics with R======

 
**Summary:**  Translate Matlab code in the Spatial Econometrics Toolbox
for Bayesian methods into R.


**Description:**
The Spatial Econometrics Toolbox ([[http://www.spatial-econometrics.com/]]) provides 
cutting edge methods for Spatial Econometrics. Some of the functions implemented therein 
are already available in some R packages (e.g., spdep). Bayesian methods for Spatial
Econometrics have not been implemented in R so far. This project will focus on
translating the Matlab code for these methods into R.

The models to translate include:

- Spatial autoregressive model

- Spatial autoregressive probit model

- Spatial autoregressive tobit model

The students will also develop a vignette based on datasets from the 
Spatial Econometrics Toolbox.


**Skills required:** 

The student will need some knowledge of Matlab and R. A good understanding of
computational Bayesian methods such as MCMC (and Gibbs sampling, in particular) 
will be necessary too. The student will need to work with some packages on spatial 
econometrics (such as spdep) and the coda package for processing MCMC output.


**Test:**

The student should demonstrate proficiency in Matlab and R. Some proof of
having a good knowledge of computational Bayesian methods is required too
(but a graduate course on Bayesian analysis will suffice).


**Mentor:** Virgilio GÃ³mez-Rubio will act as the main mentor. Another (backup) mentor will
be required too.
