Meucci GSOC 2013

===== Summary ===== 
Extend the functionality of the ''Meucci'' package with additional research by Attilio Meucci, a thought leader in risk and portfolio management.




===== Description ===== 
Attilio Meucci is a pioneer in advanced risk and portfolio management. His innovations include Entropy Pooling (technique for fully flexible portfolio construction), Factors on Demand (on-the-fly factor model for optimal hedging), Effective Number of Bets (entropy-eigenvalue statistic for diversification management), Fully Flexible Probabilities (technique for on-the-fly stress-test and estimation without re-pricing), and Copula-Marginal Algorithm (algorithm to generate panic copulas).  Attilio Meucci serves as the chief risk officer at Kepos Capital LP. Concurrently, he is adjunct professor at the Master's in Financial Engineering – Baruch College - CUNY.

Prof. Meucci frequently includes Matlab code alongside his key papers to better demonstrate the concepts.  We have started and would like to continue to convert that code to R to make it more widely assessible.

During last summer's GSoC, we sponsored a related project that benefited from a very generous contribution of ported code from Ram Ahluwalia at Wingfoot Capital.  The project focused on that code contribution and established a stand-alone package named ''Meucci'' that is now available on r-forge at https://r-forge.r-project.org/scm/viewvc.php/pkg/Meucci/?root=returnanalytics.  That package now contains twenty-some exported functions and six demos, along with some degree of documentation for most of them.  There is still much to do here, but the package will provide a good foundation for the proposed work.  

All of Meucci's original MATLAB source is available on www.symmys.com, where you can examine the extensive material he makes available.

Beyond the initial conversion of functions from the MATLAB code, we will functionalize certain functions to include in PerformanceAnalytics, PortfolioAnalytics, or developing a package around one or more of the concepts described above, starting with the Effective Number of Bets.  PerformanceAnalytics is an R package that provides a collection of econometric functions for performance and risk analysis. PortfolioAnalytics is an extensible business-focused framework for portfolio optimization and analysis.

This project will be pursued in three pieces.  In the first, the student
will focus on Meucci (2012), where he provides a framework for computing,
stress-testing, and managing liquidity risk, funding risk and market risk
in fully general multi-asset class portfolio.  Specifically, this will
include porting Meucci's MATLAB code and carefully verifying the resulting
calculations to ensure that results match, from the following papers:

In the second part of the project, the student will functionalize certain
workflows to include in PerformanceAnalytics or other appropriate
packages. This portion of the project may focus on either the liquidity
concept described above, or Meucci's Effective Number of Bets concept,
described in Meucci (2010).

The third part of the project will focus on the continued improvement of
the Meucci package.  This will include refining functionality to remove
the need for the matlab package, identifying and reducing functional
overlap, adding more charts and graphs, and improving the documentation
and examples.

===== Skills Required =====
Applicants should have:
  * A strong interest in finance,
  * Experience using and developing in R, and comfort with tools such as svn, Roxygen2, LaTeX (for equations in particular), and familiarity with base graphics.
  * Demonstrable experience with finance-related packages.
  * The ability to read and run Matlab code to verify results.

===== Test =====
A successful applicant will:
  * Discuss the list of proposed functionality and associated visualization for inclusion based on the literature cited here.

  * Develop a specific plan with a timeline for development, documentation (consider adding a vignette as well), and testing the functionality.  

  * Provide a complete code example of a function with documentation that could be used in the Meucci package (exceptional examples will be considered for inclusion in the package and their author given full credit for the contribution).  The example does not need to pertain directly to the subject of this project, but should demonstrate your coding ability and familiarity with the tools used in developing the Meucci package and PerformanceAnalytics.

  * Clearly identify any other commitments or possible conflicts for their time during the coming summer.
