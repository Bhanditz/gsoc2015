====== spectral unmixing ======

Many types of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy|spectroscopy]] follow a bilinear model, e.g. 
* absorption in the UV/VIS/NIR/IR
* fluorescence emission
* Raman emission

The spectrum //X (λ)// of a mixture of m substances is a linear combination of the pure substance spectra //S,,i,, (λ)// weigthed with their concentrations //c,,i,,//

%%$$X (λ) = sum_(i = 1)^m c_i S_i (λ)$$%%

or, written with matrices for n spectra:

**X**^^(//n// x //p//)^^ = **C**^^(//n// x //m//)^^ **S**^^(//m// x //p//)^^ + ε

where **X** is the matrix of observed mixture spectra, measured at //p// distinct wavelengths, the concentrations are stored in **C**, and the pure componnent spectra in **S**.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaging_spectroscopy#Unmixing|Spectral unmixing]] tries to reverse this and find pure component spectra and concentrations from the observed spectra. A number of approaches exist, which follow different heuristics and constraints (e.g. spectra and concentrations should be non-negative, the pure component spectra actually exist in the observed matrix, ...).

Several algorithms are described in the literature, and I also have Matlab code of Vertex Component Analysis and NFINDR.

===== Aim of the project =====

Aim of the project is to implement/port spectral unmixing methods to R.

===== Requirements =====

R, possibly C++

git/svn

===== Test =====

Please contact me for a test task.
