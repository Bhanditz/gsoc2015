[[https://groups.google.com/group/gci-r|gci-r@googlegroups.com]]!!!**

Details of the competition can be found [[http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-code-in-are-you-in.html|here]]

===== Status and Timeline =====

* [[http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-code-in-are-you-in.html|Nov 9]]: Google announces whether R foundation is accepted as a mentoring organisation for 2011, and proposals for R projects start to be considered.
