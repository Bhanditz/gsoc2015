====== Graph of Dependencies for different GUI toolkits in R ======

 
**Task Summary:** Develop  a figure that shows the use of the different GUI toolkits available in R.

**Task Description:** 
The graph should show the different GUI toolkits, and how many / which packages rely on them to:
  - enhance it
  - depend on the toolkit  
  - are suggested

One difficulty that needs to be solved is that the package dependency description does not specify that a package depends on one of a list of packages (see e.g. gwidgets). These are hopefully listed in Suggests.

[[http://csgillespie.wordpress.com/2011/03/23/graphical-display-of-r-package-dependencies/|Colin Gillespie's blog article]] is a good starting point.
