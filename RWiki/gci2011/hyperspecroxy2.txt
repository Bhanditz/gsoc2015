====== Refactor Doc Comments to use roxygen2 ======

 
**Task Summary:** Make sure the doc comments work with roxygen2

**Task Description:** Currently, hyperSpec uses a patched version of roxygen for creating the man pages. As roxygen is not under active development, but instead roxygen2 is available, the documentation should be adapted.

  - check all exisiting doc comments for their compatibility with roxygen2
  - track down incompatibilities (will be particularly related to S4 documentation; this list may serve as wishlist for roxygen2)
  - correct the problems

**Skills needed:** R

**Rating:** Medium
