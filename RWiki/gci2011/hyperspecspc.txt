====== .spc import for hyperSpec ======

 
**Task Summary:** Write an import function for spectra stored in .spc file format.

**Task Description:** The spc file format is a binary format to store spectroscopic data.  The specification is available ([[https://ftirsearch.com/features/converters/gspc_udf.zip|zipped Specification]]), it is a typical binary stucture containing header / subheader and data sections. HyperSpec is an R package to work with spectroscopic data which should be extended so that .spc files can be imported.

A pure R version already exists, but is too slow for some applications.

**Skills needed:** Reading of the file should preferrably be in C/C++, which can be directly invoked via the Rcpp package.

**Rating:** hard (the file format has lots of subformats)

**Category:** Code (note there is a corresponding Quality Assurance task)
