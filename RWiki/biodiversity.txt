**Title:** Biodiversity data visualization in R

**Description:**

R is increasingly being used in Biodiversity information analysis. There are several R packages like rgbif and rvertnet in rOpenSci suite to query, download and to some extent analyse the data within R workflow. We also have packages like dismo, randomForest and SDMTools for modelling the data. It will be useful to have a package to quickly visualize biodiversity data. These visualizations would be helpful to understand extent of geographical, taxonomic and temporal coverage, gaps and biases in data.

The functions provided would be for following tasks:

  * Data preparation - The data needs to be converted into suitable format for visualizations and analysis i.e. date format, taxonomic classification and geographical co-ordinates should be in uniform and usable formats.

  * Geographic coverage - functions to visualize the data points on maps, density maps at different scales like Country level, Degree grid and so on.

  * Temporal coverage - functions to visualize the data on different temporal scales like monthly / annual counts, seasonality of data by months, weeks or days, Chronohorogram. [Ref:http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts359]

  * Taxonomic coverage -  functions to visualize the taxonomic coverage of data in Tree Map formats by Number of records per species and number of species covered.

  * Completeness analysis - functions to assess and visualize completeness of biodiversity inventory of the region [Ref:http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2007.04627.x ]
