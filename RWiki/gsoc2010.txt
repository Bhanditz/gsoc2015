==== Proposal Suggestions ====

Submission of unsolicited proposals (via, say, the mailing list mentioned in the next paragraph) is certainly welcome.  However, each proposal has a big barrier to pass: it will to need explain why this particular project is of use to the community, and it will have to show how it can be achieved in three months. At a minimum, a submission should also include a review of related packages that address the same or similar problems and discuss how these packages are not sufficient to the task.


===== Discussion List =====

A  [[http://groups.google.com/group/gsoc-r|Google groups mailing list]] has been created for mentors and prospective students. Please subscribe so that you can post to ''gsoc-r@googlegroups.com'' for any discussions pertaining to R and the GSoC 2010.
