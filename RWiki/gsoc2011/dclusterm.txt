====== DClusterm: Model-based detection of disease clusters

**Summary:** Model-based detection of disease clusters

**Background** The analysis of disease data is important in order to
detect disease outbreaks and links to risk factors. Some of the methods
for cluster detection have been implemented in the DCluster package.
However, a model-based approach would be of interest in order to explore
disease incidence to potential risk factors.

**Description** Model-based clustering will be implemented using Generalized
Linear Models (in principle, for Poisson and Binomial families). Clustering
will be modelled as dummy variables (1=area is in a cluster, 0=area is not
is a cluster). Hence, many possible clusters will be proposed and the
most likely cluster will be selected according to likelihood ratio test, AIC 
and (possibly) any other reasonable method.

**Skills required:** : A good working knowledge of R and Generalized Linear Models.
Some understading of spatial statistics will be a plus.

**Test:** Fit a GLM using the North Carolina SIDS data. See example("readShapePoly") in maptools package. In this GLM, SID74 will be the outcome and BIR74*sum(SID74)/sum(BIR74) an offset; the Poisson family will be used. In addition, a dummy variable representing a spatial cluster
will be included. This dummy variable will include 5 different contiguous regions (i.e., the
value of this dummy variable will be 1 for these 5 regions and 0 otherwise). Display the
residuals of this model in a map.
