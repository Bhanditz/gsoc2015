**Summary:** Interactive graphical R applets for teaching statistics and calculus

**Description:** Many concepts in statistics and calculus can be illuminated powerfully by interactive graphical displays: call them applets.  For example, in a statistical modeling class, an applet can be used to show the effect of adding interaction terms to a model, or how solutions to sets of linear equations are found.  In calculus, an applet can show how the quality of a polynomial approximation changes as the order is increased.  Indeed, just about any static textbook illustration can be made more effective by the addition of interactivity: changing parameters, model orders, initial conditions, etc.  The RStudio IDE makes possible the creation of interactive graphical applets using its built-in manipulate package.

This project will develop about 20 manipulate applets to illustrate various concepts encountered in statistics and calculus.  The applets will be published as part of Project MOSAIC, an NSF-supported curricular development initiative that encourages greater use of sophisticated computing in introductory college-level calculus and statistics courses.  

**Skills required:** Proficiency in general R programming and constructing custom graphical displays.  Familiarity of basic principles of statistics and calculus (through multivariate) that will be the objects of the applets.

**Test:** Test: The ability to write an R function that can display a cobweb plot, that is, the iteration of the system x_{i+1} = g( x_i ) such as the logistic map in a chaotic regime. (A rough example of such a plot is at http://math.la.asu.edu/~chaos/logistic.html)
