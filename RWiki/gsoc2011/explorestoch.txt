**Summary:** To develop functions for exploratory analysis and
visualization of multivariate and high-dimensional data from
stochastic dynamic processes.

**Description:** The overall objective is to contribute with functions
that can be helpful in exploring, plotting and analyzing data from
high-dimensional dynamic systems, in particular, emphasizing the
internal dynamic of the process. The results may be embedded in the
processdata package (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/multdiff/).

Some concrete data examples and ideas are:

  * Gene expression dynamics. 

Time course gene expression measurements
are very high-dimensional dynamic processes -- often observed at
relatively few time points. Some of the scientific objectives include
the ability to identify groups of genes that are co-regulated, genes
that react to external stimuli, or, more ambitiously, the regulatory
network among the genes.

  * Activities of neuron cells. 

Dynamic spike times and membrane
potentials for neuron cells form another class of dynamic stochastic
processes. A characteristic of the data is that the spike times are
discrete events. Some of the scientific objectives are to model how
the membrane potential cause spikes, and how spikes from multiple
neurons co-occur, and perhaps to infer the network among the observed 
neurons from the spike times. 

For both examples above it is of interest to visualize the dynamics.
Static (time-series) plots can be useful, in particular if the
coordinates can be grouped and color coded in a sensible way. The
proposal is, however, to focus on functions that produce animations,
e.g. using the animation R package. Besides simple 1d-animations,
2d-animations of (X_t, dX_t) based on an SDE model is of interest. 
For discrete event times a suggestion for replacing the (X_t, dX_t)
animation is to consider an (R_t, lambda_t) animation where R_t is the
time since last event and lambda_t is a (model based)
intensity. The infrastructure for handling continuous process data and
discrete event times is available in the processdata R package, and 
the R package ppstat (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/ppstat/) 
provides a class of multivariate intensity based models. 

Static plots of the above can also be implemented, but a prime
motivation for working with animations is to make it easier to visualize
concurrency or, at least, the order in time of the dynamic behavior of
the processes. 

To better represent signaling cascades, a
more ambitious goal could be to superimpose a 1d-animation 
on a graph that represent the direct interactions between the process
components, and, for instance, use color coding to represent the
values of the process, spike times, time since last event etc.

  * Functional data and classification. 

One can also consider  
(high-frequency) observations of a continuous signal, sometimes
referred to as functional data, with the purpose of discriminating
between two or more groups based on the signal. A concrete data
example, that can be used in the project, consists of acceleration 
signals from walking horses, where the purpose is to discriminate lame
horses from healthy horses. The signals are 3d signals.

For functional data, such as the horse data mentioned above, the
objective is to produce static plots or animations that emphasize the
discrepancies between the groups, that is, between the lame and
healthy horses in the example. 

A successful completion of this project consists of an R implementation
to solve one or more of the visualization tasks described above. The
implementation must be based on data being of one of the classes
implemented in the processdata package. It is encouraged that the
resulting visualizations are combined with techniques for dimension
reduction, clustering and color coding to aid the interpretation of
the data. 

**Skills required:** R programming, preferably with a good knowledge of R
graphics some of the R packages for plotting and visualization, 
e.g. the animation, rgl and ggplot2 packages. Knowledge of stochastic processes.

**Test:** Use svn to check code out the processdata package from R-Forge and read the vignette.
