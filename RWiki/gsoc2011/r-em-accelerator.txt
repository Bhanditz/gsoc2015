**Title:**  Convergence Acceleration of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithms in Computational Statistics:  A Suite of Cutting-Edge Acceleration Schemes

**Background:**  The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is an approach to solving certain classes of optimization problems. Although it is most popular in statistics due to the seminal work of Dempster, Laird and Rubin (J Royal Stat Soc Ser B, 1977), the EM idea is quite broadly applicable in a variety of problems without any probabilistic data generating mechanism.  Lange and others (J Comp Graph Stat, 2000) have shown that the EM algorithm can be subsumed under the more general minorization-maximization or majorization-minimization (MM) approach.  Both EM and MM are globally convergent and have linear local convergence under weak regularity conditions.  Their global convergence (i.e., convergence to a stationary point from any starting value) is a wonderful property that equips them with stability rarely seen in numerical algorithms.  They are easy to implement and also have minimal memory requirements.  All of these properties make them very attractive in simple, small to moderate size problems. However, their rate of linear convergence is typically quite small in many practical applications.  This is a major impediment to the use of EM in high-dimensional problems or in problems where the E or M step computations are demanding.  Thus, there is a real need to accelerate the small, linear rate of convergence of the EM.  In particular, there is a need for algorithms that can accelerate EM without destroying its hallmark global convergence.

**Description of the Project:**
Varadhan and Roland (Scan J Stats 2008) proposed a unique and remarkably simple acceleration scheme that is also globally-convergent. This is called SQUAREM.  This has already been implemented in an R package called SQUAREM. This work has motivated the development of newer acceleration methods based on the classical quasi-Newton (Zhou and Lange; Stat Comp 2011) and conjugate gradient algorithms (He and Liu, Tech Report 2010), as well as those closer in spirit to SQUAREM itself (Berlinet and Roland; Stat Comp 2009). The acceleration methods can accelerate any smooth, linearly convergent fixed-point algorithms. Therefore, they will be broadly applicable to a large class of problems beyond EM and MM (e.g., power method for computing dominant eigenvector, equilibrium game theory in economics). The goal of this project is to develop an R package that will make all of these latest developments in fixed-point acceleration available to analysts via an easy-to-use interface that is provided by R.  

**Skills Required:** A good working knowledge of R and some background in optimization and statistics.

**Test:** Implement in R one particular instance of an EM or MM algorithm in the statistics literature from any of the articles cited so far or from the book of McLachlan and Krishnan (The EM Algorithm and Its Extensions, Wiley  1997).  You can choose any EM or MM example.
