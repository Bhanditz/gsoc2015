====== Google Summer of Code 2013 ======


This wiki page will be the central hub of information about the [[http://www.r-project.org|R Project]] participation in the [[http://code.google.com/soc/|Google Summer of Code]] (GSoC) for 2013. Administrators are Toby Dylan Hocking, Brian Peterson, and Virgilio Gomez Rubio as a backup. Questions should be posed to the google group!

**!!!Everyone who wants to participate in this year's Google Summer of Code with R please join our google group:

[[https://groups.google.com/group/gsoc-r|gsoc-r@googlegroups.com]]!!!** make sure to explain your relationship to R and your interest in the program.... requests without any other identifying or qualifying information may be considered spam.

===== Overview =====

In short, each student will get paid $5000 to work on an R package for 3 months during the summer:

  * Mentors can add projects to this wiki page to give ideas to students.
  * Students should look at the list of projects and see if any project interests them. If so, email the project mentors to express your interest, and describe any prior experience. Students with ideas for R projects not listed below are encouraged to post a query on the [[https://groups.google.com/group/gsoc-r|gsoc-r google group]].
  * Students will submit project applications directly to Google. The home page is [[http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013]]
  * Google will award a certain number of student slots to the R project.
  * The GSOC-R administrators and mentors will rank projects in order of importance to the R project, and the top projects will be funded.
  * Students get paid $5000.
  * Mentors get code written for their project, but no money.

===== Project Ideas =====

Project proposals are welcome, and should be added to the list below.  However, each proposal has a big barrier to pass: it will to need explain why this particular project is of use to the community, and it will have to show how it can be achieved in three months. At a minimum, a submission should also include a review of related packages that address the same or similar problems and discuss how these packages are not sufficient to the task.

Anton created a great working prototype of an xts-like object that can contain multi-type columns. Work next year could include: improving performance, and fixing bugs and refining edge cases by exploring use-cases. |
