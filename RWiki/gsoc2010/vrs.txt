====== Virtual R Supercomputer ======
 
**Summary:** Develop an R interface that runs on BOINC (the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing).

**Details:** There are a large number of packages dedicated to high-performance computing with R.  To get real performance improvements out of parallel computing, each of these packages assumes either direct access to a grid or adds the additional expense of using something like Amazon EC2. 

BOINC has about 605,000 active computers (hosts) worldwide processing on average 4.6 petaFLOPS as of Mar 4th 2010 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Open_Infrastructure_for_Network_Computing).  These hosts volunteer their resources for scientific research.  The vrs package will allow any researcher to submit a self-contained R simulation to be run across the BOINC network of computers, giving researchers direct access to vast computing power at no cost.

**Skills:** Good R and C++ programming skills.  Familiarity with basic open source development tools like svn and make is assumed.  Experience with Debian or Ubuntu Linux. 

**Tests:** 
  - Use RInside (http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rinside.html) to write a C++ application that calculates the value of Pi using a monte carlo approach with R (see rosetta code for an example implementation of the R code: http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods#R).  The looping part of the operation should in the C++ layer.
  - Describe, in words, what the following BOINC functions do: get_output_file_info, create_work, boinc_init_parallel, boinc_wu_cpu_time.
  - Run the "Quick Start" BOINC example application (can be run as a virtual machine to limit setup time).
